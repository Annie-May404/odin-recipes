    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Fudgey brownies are the best brownies, so I had 
        to add a brownie recipe. <a href="https://www.inspiredtaste.net/24412/cocoa-brownies-recipe/"
        target="_blank" 
        rel="noopener noreferrer">
            I found this one here on imspiriedtate.net.</a>
            It's a really good recipe. The steps are a 
            little different from other brownie recipes I've 
            made, but it's actually a little easier than 
            the others.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 &frac14 cups of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>&frac34 cup plus 2 tablespoons of unsweeted 
            cocoa powder, spooned and leveled
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanillia extract</li>
        <li>&frac14 teaspoon of fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large, cold eggs</li>
        <li>&frac12 cup of all-purpose flour, 
            spooned and leveled
        </li>
        <li>(optional) &frac23 cups of chopped walnuts, 
            pecans, or chocolate chips
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven and prep pan: Position 
            an oven rack in the middle of the oven 
            and preheat to 325 Fahrenheit. Line the 
            bottom and sides of the 8-inch square 
            baking pan with parchment paper or 
            aluminum foil, leaving an overhang 
            on opposite sides to help remove 
            the baked brownies from the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Melt the butter: Add the butter to a medium 
            saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and cook 
            until the butter melts completely, then turn 
            off the heat. Stay close, and do not let it brown.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the sugar and cocoa: While the butter 
            is hot, stir in the sugar, cocoa powder, vanillia, 
            and salt. Stir well until blended. Don't worry 
            if the batter looks gritty. Once you add the eggs 
            later, the brownie batter will become smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Cool the mixture slightly: Set the saucepan aside to 
            cool until the mixture is warm, not hot, 5 to 10 
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the eggs: Add the cold eggs, one at a time, 
            stirring vigorously after each egg.
        </li>
        <li>Beat in the flour: When the batter looks 
            thick and well blended, add the flour. 
            Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter 
            until it is very thick and pulls away from the 
            sides of the bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Add optional mix-ins: If using, stir in nuts or 
            chocolate chips.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the brownies: Scrape the thick batter 
            into your prepared pan and spread it evenly, 
            pushing it into the corners. Bake for 20 to 
            30 minutes, or until the edges look set 
            and the middle is slightly underbaked. A 
            toothpick inserted into the center should 
            come out with somewhat moist batter.
        </li>
        <li>Cool and slice: Let the brownies cool 
            completely in the pan to ensure they set 
            properly. To cut them, use a sharp chef's 
            knife, wiping the blade clean after each 
            slice to perfect edged. For even 
            cleaner edges, chill the brownies in the fridge 
            for 1 to 2 hours before slicing.
