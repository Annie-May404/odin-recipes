    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Leom is the best flavor. For the next recipe, I found one for 
        lemon squares, or lemon bars. They're an underrated desert option 
        that's light, refreshing, and gooey with a satisfy crunch from the 
        shortbread crust.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Shortbread Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>&frac12 cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>&frac12 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>2 cups and 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Lemon Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoon of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <1i>1 cup of lemon juice (about 4 lemons)</1i>
        <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Line the 
            bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch glass baking pan (do 
            not use metal) with parchment paper, leaving an overhang 
            on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting
            easier). Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Make the crust: Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanillia 
            extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the 
            flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will 
            be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure 
            the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes 
            or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the 
            oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the 
            warm crust (not all the way through the crust). This 
            helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place.
            Set aside until step 4.
        </li>
        <li>Make the filling: Sift the sugar and flour together in 
            a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice 
            until completely combined.
        </li>
        <li>Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 
            22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and 
            no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an 
            oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven snd cool 
            completely at room temperature for about 2 hours. Put in 
            the refrigerator for 1-2 hours to chill. 
        </li>
        <li>Once cool, lift the parchment paper out of the 
            pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with 
            confectioners' sugar and cut into squares before 
            serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean 
            between each cut. Cover and store leftover 
            lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
        </li>
