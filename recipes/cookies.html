    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baking is a cute hobby of mine, so I decided to share all baking recipes.
        First up is a chocolate chip cookie recipe, since those are the most
        iconic baked good in my very biased opinion. <a href="https://joyfoodsunshine.com/the-most-amazing-chocolate-chip-cookies/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a link to the original 
        recipe by Laura.</a>
        The recipe's easy to follow, and you get soft, chewy cookies.
